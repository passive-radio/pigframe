<b>Pigframe</b> is a minimum Python-based game-engine backend library, designed to simplify and streamline the development process of game applications. Engineered with flexibility and ease of use in mind, Pigframe provides a robust set of tools and functions that enable developers to create immersive and dynamic gaming experiences.

#### Key Features:
- <b>Component-Based Architecture</b>: Pigframe adopts a component-based approach, allowing for modular and scalable game development. This architecture facilitates easy addition, modification, and management of game elements.

- <b>Intuitive Scene Management</b>: Manage game scenes seamlessly with Pigframe's intuitive scene transition and control system. This feature allows for smooth transitions and efficient scene organization.

- <b>Efficient Entity-Component System</b>: At the heart of Pigframe is an efficient entity-component system (ECS), which promotes a clean separation of concerns and enhances performance.

- <b>Pythonic Simplicity</b>: Designed with Python's philosophy of simplicity and readability, Pigframe is ideal for those learning game development or individual developers seeking an accessible yet powerful tool.

- <b>Versatile Integration</b>: Pigframe is optimized to work seamlessly with popular Python game libraries like Pyxel and Pygame, making it a perfect choice for diverse and creative game development projects.

#### Getting Started:
To get started with Pigframe, simply install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install pigframe
```

#### User guide:

- import module
    ```python
    from pigframe.world import World, System, Event, Screen, Component
    ```

- create your own world class which has entities, components, systems, events and screens. It is the core of the game.
    ```python
    # Implement World class for your own project.
    class App(World):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.init() # write initial process which is unique to the game engine and the game you develop.
        
        ... # other game engine unique methods.
    
    app = App()
    ```

- create and remove entity
    ```python
    # Create entity to world.
    entity = app.create_entity() # -> int: entity ID
    # Remove entity from world.
    app.remove_entity(entity) # deletes from entites list
    ```

- add/remove components to entity
    - add components to entity
        ```python
        # Add component to entity ID.
        # Components are recorded as values where entity ID is the key inside dict.
        # Component instance are created automatically.
        app.add_component_to_entity(entity, ComponentA, component_argsA) # ComponentA is not an instance of Component but type.
        app.add_component_to_entity(entity, ComponentB, component_argsB) # ComponentB is not an instance of Component but type.
        # getter
        app.get_component(ComponentA) # Returns the list of tuple: entity id which has ComponentA, component implementation. 
        app.get_components(ComponentA, ComponentB) # Returns the list of tuple: entity id which has ComponentA and ComponentB, component implementations. 
        ```

    - remove components from entity
        ```python
        app.add_component_to_entity(ent, ComponentA, component_argsA)
        app.add_component_to_entity(ent, ComponentB, component_argsB)
        app.remove_component_from_entity(ent, ComponentA) # remove single component instance from entity

        app.add_component_to_entity(ent, ComponentC, component_argsC)
        app.remove_components_from_entity(ent, ComponentB, ComponentC) # remove components instances from entity
        ```

- use component values inside system, event and screen
    ```python
    # Example of using get_components() method.
    class SystemA(System):
        def process(self):
            for ent, (component_a, component_b) in self.world.get_components(ComponentA, ComponentB):
                """
                Returns
                -------
                list: list of tuple: entity id, list of components
                """
                component_a.x += component_b.x
                component_a.y += component_b.x
    ```

- use entity
    ```python
    # Example of using entity object
    class EventA(Event):
        def __process(self):
            player = self.world.get_entity_object(entity = 0)
            """
            Returns
            -----------
            dict: entity object
                key: component type
                value: component
            """
    ```

- add scenes to world
    ```python
    # Add scenes to world.
    app.add_scenes(["launch", "game", "result", "settings"])
    # scenes getter
    app.sceneces # -> [["launch", "game", "result", "settings"]
    ```

- add/remove system to/from world
    ```python
    # Add screen to a scene of world. Be sure you have added scenes before adding screens.
    # System instance are created automatically.
    app.add_system_to_scenes(SystemA, "launch", priority = 0, system_args)
    # system with its lower priority than the other systems is executed in advance., by default 0.
    # For here, SystemA().process() runs first in "launch" scene.
    app.add_system_to_scenes(SystemA, "game", priority = 0, system_args)
    app.add_system_to_scenes(SystemB, "launch", priority = 1)
    # Remove system from scene.
    app.remove_system_from_scene(SystemA, ["launch", "game"], system_args = system_args)
    ```

- add/remove screen to/from world
    ```python
    # Add screen to a scene of world. Be sure you have added scenes before adding screens.
    # Screen instance are created automatically.
    app.add_screen_to_scenes(ScreenA, "launch", priority = 0)
    app.add_screen_to_scenes(ScreenB, "launch", priority = 0)
    app.add_screen_to_scenes(ScreenC, "game", priority = 0, screen_args)
    # Remove screen from scene.
    app.remove_screen_from_scene(ScreenB, "launch")
    ```

- add/remove event to/from world
    ```python
    # Add an event, event triger to a scene of world. Be sure you have added scenes before adding events.
    # Event instance are created automatically.
    app.add_event_to_scene(EventA, "game", callable_triger, priority = 0)
    # Remove event from scene.
    app.remove_event_from_scene(EventA, "game")
    ```

- add scene transitions settings
    ```python
    app.add_scene_transition(scene_from = "launch", scene_to = "game", triger = callable_triger)
    # triger has to be callable.
    ```

- execute systems, events and draw screens
    ```python
    # Pyxel Example
    class App(World):
        ...

        def run(self):
            pyxel.run(self.update, self.draw)

        def update(self):
            self.process() # World class has process method.
            # process method calls these internal methods below.
            # 1. process_systems()
            # 1. process_events()
            # 1. scene_manager.process()

        def draw(self):
            self.process_screens()
    ```

    ```python
    # Pygame Example
    class App(World):
        ...
        
        def run(self):
            while self.running:
                self.update()
                self.draw()
                
        def update(self):
            self.process()
        
        def draw(self):
            self.process_screens()
    ```
